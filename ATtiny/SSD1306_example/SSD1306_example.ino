// Choose your I2C implementation before including Tiny4kOLED.h
// The default is selected is Wire.h

// To use the Wire library:

// The blue OLED screen requires a long initialization on power on.
// The code to wait for it to be ready uses 20 bytes of program storage space

//#define TINY4KOLED_QUICK_BEGIN

  oled.begin();

  // Two rotations are supported,
  // The begin() method sets the rotation to 1.
  //oled.setRotation(0);

  // Some newer devices do not contain an external current reference.
  // Older devices may also support using the internal curret reference,
  // which provides more consistent brightness across devices.
  // The internal current reference can be configured as either low current, or high current.
  // Using true as the parameter value choses the high current internal current reference,
  // resulting in a brighter display, and a more effective contrast setting.

  // In order to keep the library size small, text can only be positioned
  // with the top of the font aligned with one of the four 8 bit high RAM pages.
  // The Y value therefore can only have the value 0, 1, 2, or 3.
  // usage: oled.setCursor(X IN PIXELS, Y IN ROWS OF 8 PIXELS STARTING WITH 0);

  // Swap which half of RAM is being written to, and which half is being displayed.
  // This is equivalent to calling both switchRenderFrame and switchDisplayFrame.
